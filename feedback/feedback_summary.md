# Feedback Summary

This file summarizes the main feedback received across the three submissions and the improvements made throughout the project.

## Part 1
- The main feedback was about improving the link between the economic theory and the research hypothesis.
- Some explanations were not precise enough (especially in the interpretation of transformations and causal wording).
- The overall structure was acceptable, but the argumentation could be clearer and more concise.

## Part 2
- The second submission showed a clear improvement in structure and econometric analysis.
- The use of descriptive statistics, OLS, and Probit was stronger and more organized.
- Feedback highlighted the need for better interpretation in some graphs/tables and more careful wording when discussing causality.

## Part 3
- The final submission was the strongest one methodologically.
- The Difference-in-Differences approach, fixed effects, placebo test, and heterogeneity analysis significantly improved the project.
- Feedback mainly focused on refining interpretation and explaining econometric choices more clearly.

## Main Improvements Across the Project
- Better transition from theory to empirical strategy
- Stronger econometric methodology (from basic analysis to DiD and fixed effects)
- Clearer interpretation of results
- Better overall structure and academic writing
