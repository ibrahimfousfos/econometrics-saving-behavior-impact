# Feedback Summary

This document summarizes the main feedback received across the three submissions of the econometrics project and the improvements made over time.

The goal of this file is not to reproduce the professor's comments word-for-word, but to document the learning process and show how the project became stronger from Part 1 to Part 3.

---

## Part 1 — Research Question, Hypothesis, and First Exploration

### What worked
- The project started with a clear topic (impact of a salesperson meeting on saving behavior).
- The first submission already introduced a relevant econometric framing (treatment/control logic and causal reasoning).
- The dataset exploration and first transformations helped prepare the later parts of the analysis.

### Main feedback received
- The link between **economic theory** and the **research hypothesis** needed to be stronger.
- Some explanations were too general and needed more precision (especially in causal wording).
- A few methodological points (including variable transformations) needed clearer interpretation.
- The writing could be more concise and structured.

### What was improved after Part 1
- Better justification of the empirical strategy in the following submissions.
- More careful wording when discussing causality.
- Improved structure in the analysis and interpretation sections.

## Part 2 — OLS and Probit Analysis

### What worked
- The second submission showed a clear improvement in structure and organization.
- The descriptive analysis was more complete (treatment/control comparisons, summary statistics, graphs).
- The econometric workflow became more solid:
  - OLS regressions
  - Probit model
  - interpretation of coefficients and significance
- The project moved from basic exploration to a more coherent empirical analysis.

### Main feedback received
- Some graphs and tables needed stronger interpretation (not only presenting results, but explaining what they mean economically).
- Causal wording still needed caution in places (distinguishing correlation from causal effect before the final strategy).
- Some presentation details (formatting, labels, clarity) could be improved.

### What was improved after Part 2
- More explicit interpretation of results in Part 3.
- Better methodological justification for the final causal approach (DiD + fixed effects).
- Cleaner progression from descriptive evidence to causal estimation.

## Part 3 — Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Fixed Effects, and Robustness

### What worked
- This was the strongest submission in terms of econometric methodology.
- The final analysis introduced a more advanced and appropriate causal framework:
  - Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
  - Fixed effects panel regression
  - Placebo test
  - Heterogeneity analysis
- The project became much more convincing as an impact evaluation exercise.
- The interpretation and discussion were more mature than in earlier submissions.

### Main feedback received
- Some econometric choices could be explained more clearly (why this specification, what assumptions are needed, and how to interpret them).
- A few interpretations could still be refined to better connect results to economic intuition.
- Presentation and wording could be polished further for a more professional final report.

### Final outcome
- The third submission reflected a strong methodological improvement compared with the first one.
- The project evolved from an initial exploratory econometrics assignment into a more complete and credible causal analysis.

## Main Improvements Across the Whole Project

### 1) Better theory-to-model connection
The project improved in translating an economic question into a testable econometric strategy.

### 2) Stronger methodology
The analysis progressed from:
- exploration and hypothesis building
- to OLS / Probit estimation
- to a DiD + fixed effects impact evaluation framework

### 3) Better interpretation
Across the three parts, the interpretation of coefficients, significance, and economic meaning became clearer and more rigorous.

### 4) Better academic communication
The structure, writing, and overall presentation improved with each submission.

## Why This Matters for the Repository

This project is not only a final output; it also shows a progression in:
- econometric reasoning
- empirical strategy design
- causal inference methods
- interpretation and academic writing

For that reason, keeping a short feedback summary in the repository helps document both the technical work and the learning process.
